# MemReader BoF

MemReader Beacon Object File will allow you to search and extract specific strings from a target process memory and return what is found to the beacon output.
Code primarily based on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36878017/searching-for-every-occurrence-of-a-string-in-another-processs-memory
I Want to give a shout out to [osok](https://github.com/osok) for helping create this

* `git clone https://github.com/trainr3kt/MemReader_BoF.git`
